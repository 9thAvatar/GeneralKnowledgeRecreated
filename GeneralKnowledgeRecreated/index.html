    <h2>This webpage mainly focuses on giving the users
        the knowledge they need.
        <br><br>
        Initially, the knowledge is given in the form of
        facts. According to me, facts make a lot of difference
        in the mind of a normal person.
        <br><br>
        When you tell people any type of info:  Science, Biology,
        Astronomy, Physics, Geography, Chemistry, GK, etc.
        <br><br>
        You might notice that they start to get bored and really
        annoyed in a fraction of a second. But when you tell that
        same info in a fun way, meaning in the form of facts, they
        start to get a real interest in the information you're giving.
        <br><br>
        But then again, don't forget, if you start exceeding the limit
        of exaggerate too much, the same might happen again.
        <br><br>
